PyCitySchools:

This project examines school performance data to draw insights and conclusions about various aspects of the schools in the district.
The analysis includes average scores in math and reading, as well as the percentage of students passing these subjects.
It explores the impact of factors such as school size, school type, and per-student spending on student performance.

Dataset:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per-student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Overall passing rate

Analysis:
1. Summary of School Performance:
   - Overview of average scores and passing rates.

2. Impact of School Size on Performance:
   - Schools are categorized into three bins based on the total number of students:
     - Small (<1000 students)
     - Medium (1000-2000 students)
     - Large (2000-5000 students)
   - The average scores and passing rates for each category are calculated and analyzed.

3. Impact of School Type on Performance:
   - Schools are categorized by type.
   - The average scores and passing rates for each type are calculated and analyzed.

4. Impact of Spending Per Student on Performance:
   - Schools are categorized into four spending ranges:
   - The average scores and passing rates for each spending range are calculated and analyzed.

Findings:
School Size:
  - Smaller schools tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates.
  - Larger schools show a trend of lower performance compared to smaller and medium-sized schools.

School Type:
  - Charter schools generally perform better than district schools in terms of average scores and passing rates.

Per-Student Spending:
  - There is no clear correlation between higher spending per student and better performance. In some cases, schools with lower spending per student have higher passing rates and average scores.

Conclusion:
This project provides insights into the factors affecting school performance, highlighting areas where resource allocation and management could be improved to enhance student outcomes.
